We found that the executable had a ft_des function but wasn't called, and in the .rodata section there were some strange symbols, maybe the encrypted flag

We run strip to remove the main so that we can link with ft_des and try things but it didn't work

However it was a good idea because next we used gdb to call ft_des
The first prototype that comes to mind is '(char *) ft_des(char *)'
so we run 'gdb ./level13'
'break main' (to stay in the executable)
'run' (to run)
'p (char *) ft_des("boe]!ai0FB@.:|L6l@A?>qJ}I")' (this string is found in .rodata, see https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Calling.html sec. 17.5.1 for infos)
Annddd, it returns something that looks like a flag :D (it works)
