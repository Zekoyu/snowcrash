The perl scipt take querry param x, then do upper case on it, 
and then call egrep $x ... so we can probably put code to exec in it.
the code should be in uppercase format so we can create our own exec in uppercase format
then we just have to add the binary to the PATH and assign x to $(OUR_EXEC).

until now it don't seem to work on the real script but this is maybe because of the wrong format I give in the querry param (something like x="$(EXEC)"&y=0 )
(it work with custom script test.pl in local)
