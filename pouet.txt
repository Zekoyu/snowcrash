We did ls on our home directory and found a .pcap
It's a file containing a network dump
https://serverfault.com/questions/38626/how-can-i-read-pcap-files-in-a-friendly-format
tcpdump -qns 0 -X -r ./level02.pcap
opened the file in wireshark and saw Password:, found data 'ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L.....'
since Delphin is very smart he found that 0x7f (the points) were DELETE, so everytime we encounter them we removed a character, which led to ft_waNDReL0L..... so we tried 'ft_waNDReL0L'

We are only given an executable which prints "Exploit me"
So we used objdump -d ./level03 to find out the content of the program
(objdump -d name_of_your_obj_file | awk -F"\n" -v RS="\n\n" '$1 ~ /main/')
When searching the function called (getgid, getuid, setresgid, setresuid and system) we found a post (https://stackoverflow.com/q/8304396) talking about vulnerabilities with these functions
