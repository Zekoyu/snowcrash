Since the previous method seems to have worked well and we have no files in this level.
We just tried to readelf on getflag and there is also a function called ft_des.
When looking at the .rodata of /bin/getflag, we can find all the encrpyted flags NULL terminated, the last one is bigger than the others so it seemed strange.
We tried using it anyways (since it was the 15th, so the one we wanted) without truncating to 25 chars first, then as previously using gdb
we ran ft_des("g <t61:|4_|!@IF.-62FH&G~DCK/Ekrvvdwz?v|") and it returned a string.
Since we have no way to check if this string is the password of level15 (since level14 is the last), we first tried root, with no success,
Then we tried it on flag14 and it worked :D, so the flag14 is the password of flag14
