
By doing a objdump + readelf on level03 binary we can see that it 

We are only given an executable which prints "Exploit me"
So we used objdump -d ./level03 to find out the content of the program
(objdump -d name_of_your_obj_file | awk -F"\n" -v RS="\n\n" '$1 ~ /main/')
When searching the function called (getgid, getuid, setresgid, setresuid and system) we found a post (https://stackoverflow.com/q/8304396) talking about vulnerabilities with these functions

we can see the executable set the uid to flag03 and then exec("/usr/bin/env echo ...")
so by changing PATH to execute a custom echo (see echo.c) we can access a shell as flag03
