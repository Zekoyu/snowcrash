Since we have no file given, first do a 'find / -user flag05'
This gives us 2 files: /usr/sbin/openarenaserver and /rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
We have no permission on the later, for cat'ing the former gives us a script (we put in script.sh)
We can see that the script executes all scripts in /opt/openarenaserver with a timeout of 5 seconds, then delete them
scripts are executed as flag05, so we don't have the output of the given script
but we can still redirect them to a file, and read it
so we just put a script in /opt/openarenaserver with "getflag >/var/crash/bonjour" and then gg a tous
