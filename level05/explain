Since we have no file given, first do a 'find / -user flag05'
This gives us 2 files: /usr/sbin/openarenaserver and /rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
We have no permission on the later, for cat'ing the former gives us a script (we put in script.sh)
We can see that the script executes all scripts in /opt/openarenaserver with a timeout of 5 seconds, then delete them
So we tried putting a simple script with getflag in it, it is deleted so the command is runned (automatically probably, since we didn't do anything), but no output is printed
Second idea is to put 'getflag > /tmp/pouet' in our script, so that the output is saved (since we dont have permission to create files in our home we put it in /tmp like previously done)
The file we did look something like this:

#!/bin/sh
echo Pouet > /tmp/pouet.txt
getflag >> /tmp/pouet.txt

Then we can get the content by just doing 'cat /tmp/pouet.txt'
And it did nothing :(
